## Technical Details

### PWA Configuration

- **Service Worker**: Workbox-powered caching strategy
- **Icons**: Multiple sizes generated from `graph.png`
- **Theme**: Brand purple (#6A4DF3) with dark mode support

### Generated Assets
- `favicon.ico` (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `icon-192x192.png` (Android)
- `icon-384x384.png` (Android)
- `icon-512x512.png` (Android, maskable)
- `splash-1024x1024.png` (Splash screen)

### Caching Strategy
- **App Shell**: Cached for instant loading
- **Google Fonts**: Cached for 1 year
- **Static Assets**: Precached during installation
- **API Data**: Fresh data with fallback to cache

## Development

### Building PWA Assets
```bash
# Generate all PWA icons from graph.png
npm run generate-pwa-assets

# Build the PWA
npm run build

# Preview the PWA locally
npm run preview
```

### Testing PWA Features
1. Build and serve the app (`npm run build && npm run preview`)
2. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application tab
3. Check "Manifest" and "Service Workers" sections
4. Use "Add to homescreen" to test installation
5. Test offline functionality by going offline in DevTools

### Updating Icons

2. Run `npm run generate-pwa-assets`
3. Rebuild the app with `npm run build`

## Troubleshooting

### Install Button Not Showing
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (or localhost for development)
- Check that the manifest is valid in DevTools
- Verify service worker is registered successfully
- Some browsers require user engagement before showing install prompt

### Offline Not Working
- Check service worker registration in DevTools
- Verify network requests are being cached
- Clear browser cache and reinstall if needed

### Icons Not Displaying
- Ensure all icon files are present in `/public/icons/`
- Check manifest.webmanifest for correct icon paths
- Verify icon files are properly sized and formatted

## Performance

The PWA is optimized for performance with:
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Code Splitting**: Separate chunks for better caching
- **Asset Optimization**: Compressed images and minified code
- **Caching Strategy**: Smart caching for instant subsequent loads

## Security

- **HTTPS Required**: PWAs require secure connections
- **Service Worker Scope**: Limited to app origin
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Secure Headers**: Implemented for production deployment
